# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview
Using unsupervised maching learning we are creating a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for a new investment. To do this we have:
 - Preprocessed the data for Principal Compnent Analysis (PCA)
 - Reduced data dimensions using PCA
 - Clustered the cryptocurrencies using K-means
 - Visualized the results
 
Below are some of my visualizations:
